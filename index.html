    <i> The parentheses is needed for the area-function 
        since the values (base * height) are different for four triangles
        and we wont be able to put different values into the function 
        without ().
        <br>Also, if it was algebra and not a computing language, there would be 
        as many parentheses as possible, to specify not only Order of Operations,
        but that whats inside of () is one value in itself. If we would try to calculate
        base * height / 2 , value-anarchy would rule.
        <br>Initially, I wrote ((a * b) * (1/2)), as if Javascript was a very dumb calculator...
